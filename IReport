Incident Report: Network Traffic Analysis

Part 1: Summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log

The UDP protocol reveals that DNS queries from the client at IP 192.51.100.15 to the DNS server at IP 203.0.113.2 on port 53 repeatedly failed.

This is based on the results of the network analysis, which show that the ICMP error responses were received with the message:
“udp port 53 unreachable”.

The port noted in the error message, port 53, is used for:
DNS (Domain Name System) services.

The most likely issue is:
The DNS server at IP 203.0.113.2 is either down, misconfigured, or has no service listening on port 53, preventing DNS resolution for the domain "yummyrecipesforme.com".

Part 2: Analysis of the data and at least one cause of the incident

Time incident occurred:
The first ICMP error was logged at 13:24:36, indicating when the issue was first encountered.

How the IT team became aware of the incident:
Multiple customers reported that they were unable to access the website www.yummyrecipesforme.com. They encountered a "destination port unreachable" error when attempting to connect.

Actions taken by the IT department to investigate the incident:
The IT team used the tcpdump network analyzer to capture traffic while attempting to access the website. They examined the DNS queries and the corresponding responses.

Key findings of the IT department's investigation:
- DNS queries were sent via UDP from 192.51.100.15 to 203.0.113.2 on port 53.
- The DNS server responded with ICMP error messages indicating that port 53 was unreachable.
- DNS resolution failed, which prevented access to the website.

Likely cause of the incident:
The DNS server at 203.0.113.2 is either not running a DNS service, or port 53 is blocked or misconfigured, making it inaccessible for DNS queries.
